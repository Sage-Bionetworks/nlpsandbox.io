## **NLP-Sandbox Project Rules**

* You may only register once for the NLP-Sandbox Project.
* After you register individually, you may work alone or on one Team with other NLP-Sandbox Project Participants. All Teams must designate a Team Captain, and each Team member must be a registered participant in the NLP-Sandbox Project. It is up to each Team to organize its submissions and to follow the NLP-Sandbox Project submission requirements.
* Before using external data, participants should consult the NLP-Sandbox Project Description website for any limitations and any additional Data Access Terms of Use affiliated with the Project to verify that their use of a particular external data set is permitted.
* All Entries must be formatted as specified on the particular NLP-Sandbox Project Description website on Synapse. Final Entries must always include a written, publication-quality description of the submission with sufficiently clear information to allow reproducibility.
* The NLP-Sandbox Project/Sage Bionetworks make no claim to ownership of Entries or any intellectual property that they may contain. However, you grant the NLP-Sandbox Project/Sage Bionetworks the right to make public and publish your qualified Entry.
*  Entries may not include any proprietary content such as proprietary software or databases (including software/resources that require usage licenses and agreements). When submitting source code, you should provide it to the  NLP-Sandbox Project/Sage Bionetworks under an open source license that permits the NLP-Sandbox Project/Sage Bionetworks to distribute the code to the public for research and development use. If you do not provide information on licensing, submitted code shall be deemed submitted under the [FreeBSD license](http://www.linfo.org/bsdlicense.html).
*  The NLP-Sandbox Project/Sage Bionetworks makes no representations or warranties as to confidentiality.
*  Play by the rules. Suspected cheaters or those acting against the spirit of the NLP-Sandbox Project will be disqualified.
*  When applicable, publication authorship byline(s) will be awarded to the top-performing Team(s) in good standing. Project organizers reserve the right to organize the publication authorship and contribution list in their sole discretion.
*  You are free to publish the results of your method and your Team ranking at any time. However, participants agree to share the manuscript with the NLP-Sandbox Project organizers who will review it within 2 weeks and verify that it doesn’t report overall challenge results or any analysis of the overall results as these are parts of the main NLP-Sandbox Project Publication. These restrictions are lifted once the NLP-Sandbox Project Publication is online or in print.
*  By participating you are making representations to your Entry’s accuracy, propriety, noninfringement, and legal compliance, and you are agreeing to indemnify the NLP-Sandbox Project/Sage Bionetworks and various other parties from liability arising out of your participation in the NLP-Sandbox Project.
*  You are agreeing to a dispute resolution process and binding arbitration for any disputes, waiving rights to pursue damages via court.
*  All decisions of the NLP-Sandbox Project/Sage Bionetworks and the Organizers, including as to eligibility, judging and attribution, will be final and binding on all matters relating to the NLP-Sandbox Project.

## **General Information on the NLP-Sandbox Project**

The NLP-Sandbox Project is a Continuous Benchmarking project. This means that there is no "end-date" for the project and participants may continue to submit improved methods over time. 

This environment adopts the model-to-data approach [developed by Sage Bionetworks and DREAM](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4128)  to enable the evaluation of submissions on private datasets hosted by different sites. If you'd like to know more about the DREAM Challenge structure and approach that this format is based on, you can visit the [**DREAM Challenge site**](http://dreamchallenges.org) and the [**DREAM Principles**](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn6182468/wiki/401779). 

## **NLP-Sandbox Project Community Forum**

The Discussion forum will be the primary means of informal discussion, Q&A, and other interactions between the project members (organizers, participants, etc).  We encourage participants to visit the [**Discussion**](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn22277124/discussion/default) tab frequently. If you prefer, you can also receive email notifications for every new thread by clicking the **Follow** button (_highly recommended_, as updates about the NLP-Sandbox Project will be posted here):

<br/>

With the exception of sensitive topics, we **request that all Continuous Benchmarking-related questions be posed here rather than through private discussion**.  We cannot guarantee that emails directly sent to members of the Organizers team will be given priority in getting answered.

> ####! Communication Policy
> Informal language is encouraged in the forums, but remember that everything you say is public.  Please be courteous and avoid using disrespectful language -- we want to keep the forums a place of positive support for everyone.
>
> Additionally, please give the Organizers team time to respond.  We will do our best in responding to all questions posted between Monday 9AM to Friday 5PM Pacific Time within 24 hours, whereas questions posted outside of the business week (including holidays), will be answered on the following business day.
