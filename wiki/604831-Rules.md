## **General Information on Continuous Benchmarking**
This is a Continuous Benchmarking Challenge. This means that there is no "end-date" for the challenge and participants may continue to submit improved methods over time. 

This environment adopts the model-to-data approach [developed by Sage Bionetworks and DREAM](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4128)  to enable the evaluation of submissions on private datasets hosted by different sites. If you'd like to know more about the DREAM Challenge structure and approach that this format is based on, you can visit the [**DREAM Challenge site**](http://dreamchallenges.org) and the [**DREAM Principles**](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn6182468/wiki/401779). 

## **Continuous Benchmarking Community Forum**
The Discussion forum will be the primary means of informal discussion, Q&A, and other interactions between the Challenge members (organizers, participants, etc).  We encourage participants to visit the [**Discussion**](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn22277124/discussion/default) tab frequently. If you prefer, you can also receive email notifications for every new thread by clicking the **Follow** button (_highly recommended_, as updates about the Challenge will be posted here):

With the exception of sensitive topics, we **request that all Continuous Benchmarking-related questions be posed here rather than through private discussion**.  We cannot guarantee that emails directly sent to members of the Organizers team will be given priority in getting answered.

> ####! Communication Policy
> Informal language is encouraged in the forums, but remember that everything you say is public.  Please be courteous and avoid using disrespectful language -- we want to keep the forums a place of positive support for everyone.
>
> Additionally, please give the Organizers team time to respond.  We will do our best in responding to all questions posted between Monday 9AM to Friday 5PM Pacific Time within 24 hours, whereas questions posted outside of the business week (including holidays), will be answered on the following business day.
